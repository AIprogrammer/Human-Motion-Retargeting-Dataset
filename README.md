# Benchmarking Dataset for Human Motion Retargeting

# Introduction
Human Motion Retargeting abbreviated as HMR is a new benchmarking dataset used for human motion retargeting and human video generation. The dataset is a synthesized dataset based on Adobe Fuse CC, [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com). HMR dataset overall contains around 800 videos of 20 different female and male characters with different up-clothes and bottom-clothes. Since we can control the body shape and ratio while constructing the characters, it is quite easy to obtain different video with the same character identity but different body shape, such as height of the person. The details of the HMR dataset is summarized below.

| HMR |female|male|up-cloths|bottom-clothes|videos|images|animation|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Total| 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 800 | | |

Different from previous datasets, we provide continuous videos rather than single image of a same person. The clothes of the person is also given in our dataset. Therefore, HMR dataset can be used as a benchmarking dataset for different computer vision tasks:
- Pose transfer or motion retargeting
- Virtual try-on under the same or different poses
- Human video generation
